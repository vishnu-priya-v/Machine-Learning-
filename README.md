Project 1: Mall Customer Segmentation
•	A machine learning project based on K-Means clustering. This data contains details of customers who shop in a supermarket and to ﬁnd their spending score based on attributes like Customer ID, age, gender, and annual income.
•	Various visualization such as bar graph, boxplot and histogram, scatterplots were used.

Project 2 :Zoo Animal Classiﬁcation
•	It is a supervised problem in machine learning. This project is to train the model to ﬁnd which animal belongs to which class type based on the given dataset.
•	Data Visualizations done using different kinds of plots such as count plot, histogram, pie chart
•	Trained and tested data using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and, Random Forest with an accuracy between 85% and 95% and comparing each of their scores and ﬁnding the best out of  them.

Project 3 :Obesity Level Check Regression
•	A regression-based model that tests the data to ﬁnd the obesity levels of different individuals using given attributes.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis is done to get a better understanding of data  and to identify errors. 
•	Visualizations are done to bring out important aspects of the dataset.
•	Algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN are used with accuracy score of 93%,97% and 79% respectively.
